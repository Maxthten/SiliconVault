## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Application fails to start or shows blank screen?**
A: Try deleting the `SiliconVault` folder in your user data directory and restart

**Q: Image upload fails?**
A: Check if the application has file system read/write permissions

**Q: Database corruption?**
A: Use the "Database Optimization" function in settings or restore from backup

**Q: Consumption statistics inaccurate?**
A: Ensure operation logs are complete; consumption statistics are calculated based on operation logs

**Q: Application runs slowly?**
A: Try cleaning unused resource files and optimizing the database

**Q: Data import fails?**
A: Check if the CSV file format is correct; use the standard template

### Performance Optimization Recommendations

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Use the resource cleanup function in system settings
2. **Database Optimization**: Perform database optimization monthly
3. **File Management**: Delete unnecessary images and documents promptly
4. **Data Backup**: Regularly back up important data
5. **System Updates**: Keep the application version updated

### Log Viewing

**Friendly Reminder**: While SiliconVault can help you manage components, it can't help you find that 0805 capacitor that fell on the floor. That still depends on your good eyesight! 👀

**Performance Tip**: If your component library exceeds 1000 items, we recommend regularly using the database optimization function, just like giving your computer a "disk defragmentation" - it makes the system run smoother!

**Security Tip**: Please back up important data regularly. SiliconVault provides comprehensive backup mechanisms, but data security ultimately depends on the user!
